# CV Website (v1.5.0)
This is a CV Website I built using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript based on my official resume, albeit with slight differences.

Contact me through my email on the site if you have any questions.

# Improvements/changes:

* Starting today, on July 14, the closed screen will no longer be displayed.
* I made this decision because I personally thought that this will negatively impact the website. So I thought about it for about a week, and couldn't fully address the issue since I was at school focusing on my college classes. Now that I have barely enough free time, I decided to take down the HTML and CSS code that made up the screen that said that the website was going to be closed and opened for a certain time period.
* Changes should have taken effect as of right now.
